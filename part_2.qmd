# 공간데이터사이언스와 R

The second part of this book explains how the concepts introduced in the first part are dealt with using R. @sec-sf deals with basic handling of spatial data: reading, writing, subsetting, selecting by spatial predicates, geometry transformers like buffers or intersections, raster-vector and vector-raster conversion, handling of data cubes, spherical geometry, coordinate transformations and conversions.
